	  This enables building D2D-over-UDP Protocol. D2DP/UDP is a new fast
	  transport protocol designed for local WiFi networks with low drop
	  rate (WiFi-Direct or Soft-AP with no intermediate hops)

	  This protocol now works only in kernel space so if your application
	  does not run in kernelspace, say N here.
