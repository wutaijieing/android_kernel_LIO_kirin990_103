	bool "H_MM support"
	help
	  This option add some h_mm codes, needed by following modules.

if H_MM

config H_MM_SLOW_PATH_COUNT
	bool "page alloc enter slow path count"
	default n
	help
	  Say 'Y' here is you want to count page alloc slow path.

config H_MM_PAGE_TRACE
	bool "HMM page trace"
	help
	  This option enables h_mm page trace, needed by memleak check modules.

config H_MM_PAGE_TRACE_TEST
	bool "HMM page trace test"
	depends on H_MM_PAGE_TRACE
	help
	  This option enables h_mm page trace test, needed by h_mm page trace modules.

config MM_MEM_OFFLINE
	bool "Dynamic Memory Region Offline driver"
	depends on MEMORY_HOTPLUG
	help
	  Add support for DDR Self-Refresh power management through the dynamic
	  memory offline framework. This driver interfaces between the memory
	  hotplug subsystem and AOP which hot adds or removes memory blocks and
	  controls the start/stop of self-refresh of these DDR regions. This
	  helps reduce power consumption during idle mode of the system.

config MM_BOOTMEM_OPTIMIZE

	depends on HAVE_ARCH_PFN_VALID
	depends on !HAVE_MEMBLOCK_NODE_MAP
	help
	  Orign bootmem_init in zone init function "memmap_init_zone" waste too much time
	  in iterate zone [start, end) pfn and judge if the pfn is valid, and when memory
	  has hole, it will cost too much time. So let it only iterate memory which in memblock.

config PM_PEAK
	bool "Physical Memory Peak"
	default n
	help
	  Record physical memory peak for each task.

config KSWAPD_DEBUG
	bool "kswapd debug"
	default n
	help
	  Provide extra log to find why kswapd is running frequently.

config REFAULT_IO_VMSCAN
	bool "Refault io vmscan"
	default n
	help
	  This is a new vmscan algorithm to balance anon and file lru reclaim ratio by
	  detect file and anon refault cost. This can more effectivity reclaim memory and
	  decrease totoal refault count and maybe decrease system cost.
