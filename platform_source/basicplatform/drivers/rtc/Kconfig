          If you say yes here, the system time (wall clock) will be set using
          the value read from a specified RTC device. This is useful to avoid
          unnecessary fsck runs at boot time, and to network better.

	  If you say yes here you get support for PMIC
	  RTC functions. If an interrupt is associated with the device,
	  the alarm functionality is supported.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called rtc-pmic-spmi.
