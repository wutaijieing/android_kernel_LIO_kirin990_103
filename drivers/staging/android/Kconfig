config ASHMEM
	bool "Enable the Anonymous Shared Memory Subsystem"
	depends on SHMEM
	help
	  The ashmem subsystem is a new shared memory allocator, similar to
	  POSIX SHM but with different behavior and sporting a simpler
	  file-based API.

	  It is, in theory, a good memory allocator for low-memory devices,
	  because it can discard shared memory units when under memory pressure.

config ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER
	bool "Android Low Memory Killer"
	help
	  Registers processes to be killed when low memory conditions, this is useful
	  as there is no particular swap space on android.

	  The registered process will kill according to the priorities in android init
	  scripts (/init.rc), and it defines priority values with minimum free memory size
	  for each priority.

config ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER_AUTODETECT_OOM_ADJ_VALUES
	bool "Android Low Memory Killer: detect oom_adj values"
	depends on ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER
	default y
	help
	  Detect oom_adj values written to
	  /sys/module/lowmemorykiller/parameters/adj and convert them
	  to oom_score_adj values.

config ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER_DAEMON
	bool "Android Low Memory Killer Daemon"
	depends on !ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER
	default n
	help
	  This is a userspace daemon process used to kill processes in low-memory situations.
	  ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER_DAEMON and ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER can only choose one.
config DEBUG_KINFO
	bool "Debug Kernel Information Support"
	depends on KALLSYMS
	help
	  This supports kernel information backup for bootloader usage.
	  Specifics:
	   - The kallsyms symbols for unwind_backtrace
	   - Page directory pointer
	   - UTS_RELEASE
	   - BUILD_INFO(ro.build.fingerprint)

config HUAWEI_RCC
	tristate "RAM Compress and Clean"
	depends on SYSFS && SWAP
	default n
	help
	  Creates background thread for compress and clean used RAM
	  dynamiclly,enabled by write 1 to /sys/kernel/rcc/enable.

config HUAWEI_RCC_DEBUG
	bool "RAM Compress and Clean debug support"
	depends on HUAWEI_RCC
	default n
	help
	  This option adds additional debugging code to the
	  RAM Compress and Clean module.

config MM_SMART_RECLAIM
    bool "Enable smart reclaim"
    default y
    depends on PROCESS_RECLAIM
    help
      When enabled, memory pages of background processes will be reclaimed.
      Depending on if the process is an application or service.
      In case of service, advise kernel to reclaim file backed pages
      of background processes(file tpyes .dex, .jar and/or .apk).
      This triggered by writting soft to /proc/<pid>/reclaim from user space.
